# Boot and recovery troubleshooting {#setup-troubleshooting-boot status=ready}

What to do if your Raspberry Pi does not boot, network is unreachable etc.

## The Raspberry Pi does not have power

Symptom: The red LED on the Raspberry Pi is OFF.

Resolution: Press the button on the side of the battery ([](#troubleshooting-battery-button)).

## The Raspberry Pi has power but it does not boot

Symptom: The Raspberry Pi has power but it does not boot.

Resolution: [Initialize the SD card](#setup-duckiebot) if not done already. Try again if done instead.

## Hanging {#troubleshooting-hanging}

Symptom: The Pi hangs when you do `docker pull` commands or otherwise and sometimes shuts off.

Resolution: An older version of the SD card image had the docker container `cjimti/iotwifi` running but this was found to be causing difficulties. `ssh` into your robot by some method and then execute:

    duckiebot $ docker rm $(docker stop $(docker ps -a -q --filter ancestor=cjimti/iotwifi --format="{{.ID}}"))
    duckiebot $ sudo systemctl unmask wpa_supplicant
    duckiebot $ sudo systemctl restart networking.service

## Flashing the microcontroller

Symptom: The LEDs light up in a variety of colors when the battery is plugged in.

Resolution: The LEDs of the Duckiebot should light up in white as soon as you power the Duckiebot. If the LEDs turn on and shine in any different color than white, probably the code on the microcontroller is corrupted. You can reflash it using the following procedure:

`ssh` into your robot and clone the Duckietown Software repository with:

    duckiebot $ git clone https://github.com/duckietown/Software.git ~/Software

install avrdude and gcc with:

    duckiebot $ sudo apt-get update
    duckiebot $ sudo apt-get install bison autoconf flex
    duckiebot $ sudo apt-get install gcc-avr binutils-avr gdb-avr avr-libc avrdude
    duckiebot $ sudo apt-get install build-essential

Copy the avrdude config file with:

    duckiebot $ cd ~/Software/hardware/software
    duckiebot $ cd _avrdudeconfig
    duckiebot $ sudo cp avrdude.conf /etc/avrdude.conf

Test avrdude and set fuses with:

    duckiebot $ cd ~/Software/hardware/software
    duckiebot $ make fuses

if the output of `make fuses` is at the end like

    avrdude: verifying â€¦
    avrdude: 1 bytes of efuse verified

    avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:FF, H:DF, L:E2)


    avrdude done.  Thank you.

the connection to the microcontroller works and the fuses could be written. The fuses are some low lowlevel settings, which just have to be set once. If this succeeded, jump the next step.


If there is the message "make: warning: Clock skew detected. Your build may be incomplete." or the make process is not stopping and many debugging messages are showed, try the following:
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> to stop the current command. Then run:

    duckiebot $ find -exec touch \{\} \;

This ensures that the modification time of all files is set to the current time. Make decides, which files have to be compiled by comparing the source file time with the executable file time. If the executable file time lies in the future regarding the current system time, not all modified files are compiled. This could happen when the clock of the Raspberry Pi is not set correctly and the file timestamps of, e.g., a github pull are used.


Next up, remove all temporary files, so everything has to be compiled freshly by running:  

    duckiebot $ make clean

Compile the programm and download it to the microcontroller by running:

    duckiebot $ make

the output should look like:

    Errors: none

    avrdude done.  Thank you.

With that, the microcontroller should work. To change the microcontroller programm, just edit the files, e.g with vim. With `make` you can compile and download the programm to the microcontroller again.

In the end, make sure to delete the Software repository to free up the space again. This is done by running:

    duckiebot $ rm -rf ~/Software
